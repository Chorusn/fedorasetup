read the jail.local file thats how the fail2ban /etc/fail2ban/jail.local file should look like and make sure the ignore ip is set to be your device's ip
here's the command to check the device's ip = hostname -I
the host file which you should backup is on /etc/hosts 
and also make sure the command shasum is available and brew installed (its on cliapps.sh)
